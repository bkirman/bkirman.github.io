    <p>This page is an intermittently updated summary of what I'm currently up to, and where my efforts are currently directed. It is based on <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">Now pages</a>, and the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1288">.plan files</a> from back in the day. It is not meant to be a complete summary, just a little note.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<ul>
<li>Working on supporting <a href="/projects/play-on">PlayOn!</a> partners with their new immersive theatre productions. There are some super cool things ongoing that I look forward to sharing next year - most productions will be on stage in summer/autumn.</li>
<li>Developing (with Oliver Bates) the card game output of <a href="/projects/switch-gig">Switch Gig</a> and the sister project <a href="http://www.flipgig.org/">Flip Gig</a>.</li>
<li>Currently speaking to people interested in studying games PhDs in the <a href="https://iggi.org.uk">IGGI</a> CDT (deadline Jan '22)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Teaching</h2>
<ul>
<li>Finished another year of the Y3 option Mobile Interaction with our IM students. Another great year with some sound projects.</li>
<li>Research leave (for PlayOn) from Jan - Mar, then I'll be doing the project prep module for Y2s from April.</li>
<li>From September I'm looking forward to teaching on IGGI</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other</h2>
<ul>
<li>Got a <a href="https://www.espruino.com/">Bangle.js 2 Espruino watch</a> - my first smart watch. Trying to think of neat things to do with it. It is ace, I like tinkering with it.</li>
<li>Finally, after 3 years, hit 500 in a <a href="https://www.calcresult.com/reference/archery/target_archery_reference.html#PortsmouthRound">Portsmouth round</a> with Olympic Recurve (current PB 512).</li>
<li>Just about finished this year's 10x10 for board games, a few more rounds of <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/261624/warfighter-shadow-war-modern-night-combat-card-gam">Warfighter Shadow War</a> will do it.</li>
<li>Finished the 10xdecade challenge, where I play 10 games from 10 years ago. I played A Blood Red Banner, Castles of Burgundy, Dungeon Petz, Flash Point: Fire Rescue, Hawaii, Kingdom Builder, Martian Dice, Revolver, Skull and Taekonoko. All those games were released in 2011. Some have aged better than others.</li>
<li>Finished my 365 challenge (365 plays in 1 year) in September, helped by lots of shorter BGA sessions. Also finished my 100 New game challenge (100 games I've never played before).</li>
<li>Playing and enjoying Unpacking, Dinosaur World, Football Manager 22, and Forza Horizon 5. Disappointed by GTA trilogy on Switch.</li>
