    <p>This page is an intermittently updated summary of what I'm currently up to, and where my efforts are currently directed. It is based on <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">Now pages</a>, and the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1288">.plan files</a> from back in the day. It is not meant to be a complete summary, just a little note.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<ul>
<li>Working on supporting <a href="/projects/play-on">PlayOn!</a> partners with their new immersive theatre productions. There are some super cool things ongoing that I look forward to sharing later in the year - most productions will be on stage in summer/autumn.</li>
<li>Finalising (with Oliver Bates) the card game output of <a href="/projects/switch-gig">Switch Gig</a> and the sister project <a href="http://www.flipgig.org/">Flip Gig</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Teaching</h2>
<ul>
<li>Project Preparation and Development for Y2 IM UGs, (if you are a York student, see the VLE for material)</li>
<li>From September I'm looking forward to teaching on IGGI</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other</h2>
<ul>
<li>Playing and enjoying Rise to Ruin, Aeon's End: Legacy of Gravehold, ETS2, Airport CEO and We Are Football.</li>
<li>Feeling like I should do some kind of reflection on all the football stuff at some point - I have read dozens of football books over the past 2 years, and played so many different games of all genre and platform. For now, one strong book recommendation is <a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL3928927W/The_Miracle_of_Castel_Di_Sangro?edition=ia%3Amiracleofcasteld00joem_0"><em>The Miracle of Castel di Sangro</em> by Joe McGinniss (1999)</a>. It is a wild book, the tale is incredible, but also the author's behaviour gets increasingly bizarre as the story develops (the author has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Vision_controversy">history</a>). Also fun to google the main figures after reading.</li>
