    <p>This page is an intermittently updated summary of what I'm currently up to, and where my efforts are currently directed. It is based on <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">Now pages</a>, and the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1288">.plan files</a> from back in the day. It is not meant to be a complete summary, just a little note.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continuing working on supporting <a href="/projects/play-on">PlayOn!</a> partners with their new immersive theatre productions. The next cycle of productions is under development with some really cool projects on the way.</li>
<li>Helping Teater Vestland (Norway) with their show <a href="https://teatervestland.no/framsyningsliste/ragnarok08">@Ragnarok08</a>, which is another version of <a href="projects/%C3%A1rul%C3%B3">Áruló</a>.</li>
<li>Also working on projects with theatres in Portugal and Norway, to be announced soon. It's a busy year!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Teaching</h2>
<ul>
<li>I am Training Coordinator in York for the <a href="https://www.iggi.org.uk">IGGI doctoral training centre</a>, and am teaching the Game Design modules in 23/24.</li>
<li>In undergraduate, I am leading the Individual Project module for year 3 Interactive Media students for Semester 1, 2023/24.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wanting to play more Viticulture Continents, John Company, Missile Threat, Rangers of Shadow Deep, and Clank: Catacombs.</li>
<li>10x10 for 2023 was Rallyman: DIRT, Happy Salmon, Just One, So Clover, Aeon's End, Phantom/Corsair/Stuka Leader (each 10 times!), Warfighter WWII and Bunch of Butts!</li>
<li>10x10 years (Games from 2013) were Skull King(*), Tajemnicze Domostwo (Mysterium), Blueprints, Russian Railroads(*), Rampage (Terror in Meeple City), Caverna, Eldritch Horror(*), Sushi Go(*), Maquis(*), String Safari, and Pick-a-Polar Bear. Asterisks are ones that aged well. 2013 was a good year!</li>
<li>I also learned 113 new board/card games, and played 194, a total of 370 times. That seems like a lot, but I have a friend who completed over 900 plays in 2023!</li>
