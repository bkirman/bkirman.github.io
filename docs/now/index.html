    <p>This page is an intermittently updated summary of what I'm currently up to, and where my efforts are currently directed. It is based on <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">Now pages</a>, and the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1288">.plan files</a> from back in the day. It is not meant to be a complete summary, just a little note.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continuing working on supporting <a href="/projects/play-on">PlayOn!</a> partners with their new immersive theatre productions. The next cycle of productions is under development with some really cool projects on the way.</li>
<li>Several PlayOn productions, including <a href="projects/%C3%A1rul%C3%B3">Áruló</a>, will be at the <a href="https://szinhaz.org/en/">Theatre Olympics</a> in Budapest in late May 2023.</li>
<li>Worked with director György Vidovszky and Kolibri Szinhaz on <a href="projects/%C3%A1rul%C3%B3">Áruló (Traitor)</a>, which opened in October 22 in Budapest. The production is part of the repertoire and is shown regularly.</li>
<li>Oliver Bates and I have printed lots of copies of MEAL DEAL, related to <a href="/projects/switch-gig">Switch Gig</a> and the sister project <a href="http://www.flipgig.org/">Flip Gig</a>. This is a part of a range of critical design artefaces about cycle delivery under the banner &quot;Crank &amp; File&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Teaching</h2>
<ul>
<li>I am Training Coordinator in York for the <a href="https://www.iggi.org.uk">IGGI doctoral training centre</a>, and am teaching the Game Design modules in 23/24.</li>
<li>In undergraduate, I will again be leading the Project Preparation &amp; Development module for Interactive Media students in April 2023.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other</h2>
<ul>
<li>Playing and enjoying Aeon's End: Past and Future, Next Station: London, Euro Truck Simulator 2(!) and in general the SteamDeck. Tried and failed to enjoy Slay the Spire (again).</li>
<li>Wanting to play more Viticulture Continents, Frosthaven, and John Company.</li>
<li>10x10 for 2022 was Abandon all Artichokes, Aeon's End, Five Parsecs from Home, Hornet Leader: CAO, Railroad Ink, Railways of the World, Roll for the Galaxy, Spruance Leader, Warfighter WWII, Zero Leader.</li>
<li>10x10 years (Games from 2012) was Among the Stars, Archipelago, A Fake Artist Goes to New York(*), Love Letter, Lucky Numbers, Qwixx, Snowdonia(*), Tea Time, and Trains. Asterisks are ones that aged well. Fake Artist is still the best social deduction game.</li>
<li>Still feeling like I should do some kind of reflection on all the football stuff at some point - I have read dozens of football books over the past 3 years, and played so many different games of all genre and platform. For now, one strong book recommendation is <a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL3928927W/The_Miracle_of_Castel_Di_Sangro?edition=ia%3Amiracleofcasteld00joem_0"><em>The Miracle of Castel di Sangro</em> by Joe McGinniss (1999)</a>. It is a wild book, the tale is incredible, but also the author's behaviour gets increasingly bizarre as the story develops (the author has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Vision_controversy">history</a>). Also fun to search up the main figures after reading.</li>
