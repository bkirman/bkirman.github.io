    <p>This page is an intermittently updated summary of what I'm currently up to, and where my efforts are currently directed. It is based on <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">Now pages</a>, and the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1288">.plan files</a> from back in the day. It is not meant to be a complete summary, just a little note.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<ul>

<h2>Other</h2>
<ul>
<li>Got a <a href="https://www.espruino.com/">Bangle.js 2 Espruino watch</a> - my first smart watch. Trying to think of neat things to do with it. It is ace, I like tinkering with it.</li>
<li>Finally, after 3 years, hit 500 in a <a href="https://www.calcresult.com/reference/archery/target_archery_reference.html#PortsmouthRound">Portsmouth round</a> with Olympic Recurve (current PB 512).</li>
<li>End of year board game roundup is 467 plays of 193 different games, (122 new to me), in just 5 places!</li>
<li>Finished a bunch of challenges during 2021, including 10x10 (10 games played 10 times each): 6 Nimmt!, Can't Stop, Draftosaurus, Kingdom Builder, MicroMacro: Crime City, Pandemic Legacy: Season 0, Tiger Leader, Warfighter Shadow War, Warfighter WWII, and Zombie Teenz Evolution. And Trek 12 makes it 11x10!</li>

I played A Blood Red Banner, Castles of Burgundy, Dungeon Petz, Flash Point: Fire Rescue, Hawaii, Kingdom Builder, Martian Dice, Revolver, Skull and Taekonoko. All those games were released in 2011. Some have aged better than others.</li>
