    <p>This page is an intermittently updated summary of what I'm currently up to, and where my efforts are currently directed. It is based on <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">Now pages</a>, and the <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">.plan files</a> from back in the day. It is not meant to be a complete summary, just a little note.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>

</ul>
<h2>Other</h2>
<ul>
<li>Got a <a href="https://www.espruino.com/">Bangle.js 2 Espruino watch</a> - my first smart watch. Trying to think of neat things to do with it. It is ace, I like tinkering with it.</li>

Also need 1 more play to finish 10xdecade challenge, where I play 10 games from 10 years ago.</li>
