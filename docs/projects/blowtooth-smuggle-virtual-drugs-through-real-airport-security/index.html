<p>Blowtooth is a unique game where players must smuggle virtual contraband through real airport security. Of course, no actual crimes are committed - the game uses bluetooth to store a list of devices that are broadcasting during the airport check-in process. Later, players are challenged to find those same devices in the departure lounges.</p>

<p>The game only works when you are in a real airport. It was developed to explore the limits of pervasive gaming in public spaces where the constant surveillance of law-abiding and innocuous behaviour has become the everyday norm.</p>
<p>It challenges passengers to reconsider their position and their relationship with the faceless airport security infrastructure. If you will be treated like a smuggler in the game of security, why not engage with that in your own, playful, way? It also explores airports as familiar and interchangeable &quot;non-places&quot; that are somehow outside of the world, culturally and legally, filled with transient population who only live there a few hours at a time.</p>
<p>It is part of a collection of projects, including GetLostBot, Feckr and Fearsquare that use the geolocative capabilities of mobile phones to explore unconventional kinds of interactions in real spaces. A postmortem and reflection of the projects is in the following chapter in <em>Funology 2</em>:</p>
