<p>This was a collaboration with York-based theatre company <a href="https://pilot-theatre.com">Pilot Theatre</a>. Pilot are a fantastic group and have <a href="https://pilot-theatre.com/immersive-productions/">amazing experience in immersive and experimental storytelling</a>.</p>
<p>Pilot are partners on the <a href="/projects/play-on">PlayOn! Project</a> and together we were successful in getting funding from <a href="https://xrstories.co.uk/">UKRI XR Stories</a> to support an R&amp;D project around non-linear interactive storytelling for youth audiences. My role was as the academic advisor and consultant on the project.</p>
<p>The core concept was to build an interactive and non-linear experience around the concept of &quot;happiness&quot;, where young people piece together the stories through interaction and reflection. Although we originally thought this might be a situated exhibition-based experience, due to the pandemic it became more game-like and more portable.</p>

<p>For me it was really interesting to work together in workshops with theatre-makers, writers, and game developers and understand how to translate powerful linear stories into more fragmented experiences. How do we ensure that players &quot;get&quot; the story if they don't collect all the pieces? This design goal differs from other non-linear story-games like <a href="http://www.herstorygame.com/">Her Story</a> because there is no &quot;twist&quot; to the narratives, the experience isn't about the non-linearity, but rather uses the non-linearity as a way to immerse youth audiences in storyworlds. It also creates opportunities for reflection in the audience, as stories have strong themes of the challenges and pains of growing up.</p>

<p>The core of the story is that audience members work for the &quot;Archive of Unsent Messages&quot; that is finally being forced to digitise a collection of  trinkets, ticket stubs, napkins and photographs that have meant something to somebody. As players encounter objects they uncover a little more of the stories around the objects, and eventually an &quot;unsent message&quot; that one of the characters did not send. Audiences are asked to consider the impact of this decision on the story, and reflect on their own experiences too.</p>
<p>The game has an amazing 90's visual style to it - the developers (Johannes May and Pixelcloud) did a great job bringing to life a very specific aesthetic. The stories were created by experienced writers Zodwa Nyoni and Lydia Marchant. The project was directed by Lucy Hammond.</p>
