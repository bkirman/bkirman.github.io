    <p>(2011) Ambient digital mindreading for office workers</p>
<p><img src="images/corridor.png" alt="Image of corridor of dreams prototype"></p>
<p>In 2011 I was recruited for a Rewired State hack on experimental prototype applications for Honda, as part of the Honda/Guardian &quot;Dream Factory&quot; event.</p>
<p>Gareth Lloyd and I worked on designing a passive digital installation art piece called &quot;the Corridor of Dreams&quot;. It took the form of a lightbox framed in a &quot;thought bubble&quot; that would automatically detect passers-by, and using some clever AI algorithms™ determine their inner hopes and desires, which would instantly be reflected within the display.</p>

<p>Although quite a simple idea the implementation was technically challenging. We used the <a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/Default.aspx">LEGO NXT brick with ultrasonic sensors</a> to detect movement (in order to trigger the event), a USB webcam to capture the image of the approaching individual, <a href="http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/">OpenCV</a> to analyse the content of the image and an <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>-powered <a href="http://evilmadscience.com/productsmenu/tinykitlist/75">“Peggy” display</a> Gareth constructed, in order to create the dream display. This was all plumbed together using Python, and deployed on a concealed <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> Nettop.</p>
<p>Although quite a simple and weird project prototype, it was fun to work on a creative installation that didn't need a highbrow concept and was just joyful to use.</p>
