Hello, I am Dr Ben Kirman and I'm a Senior Lecturer (Assoc. Prof) in [Interactive Media](https://www.york.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/bsc-interactive-media/) in the [Department of Theatre, Film, Television and Interactive Media](https://www.york.ac.uk/tfti/) at the University of York in the UK, and member of the [Digital Creativity Labs](https://digitalcreativity.ac.uk/). (he/him).

## Research

I specialise in the design and implementation of interactive playful experiences that interfere with the edges of technology, culture and sensibility. I’m interested in the application of playful design to create <em>radical</em>, <em>unusual</em> and <em>challenging</em> social and locative experiences in ways that are <em>critical</em>, <em>magical</em>, <em>irreverent</em> and, most importantly, <em>fun</em>. I especially like working on projects about social justice, interactive/immersive theatre, Animal-Computer Interaction, location-based games, social games and twitter bots. I’m a fan of using speculative design, design fiction, critical design, adversarial design and other buzzwords about design.

The [projects page](/) contains a good overview of selected work – however I have published [lots of words](/publications) in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction and Games Studies. My work, especially the weirder stuff, has often been covered by traditional media, including the BBC, New Scientist, Wired, The Guardian, TIME, Metro, the New York Times, the Lincolnshire Echo and Your Cat magazine.

## Teaching

I teach on the undergraduate [BSc (Hons) Interactive Media at the University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/bsc-interactive-media/). This is an incredible course, with a fiercely interdisciplinary perspective, bringing design, development, and critical analysis together around interactive technology. I particularly love the diverse interests our students have, including programming, music, game design, filmmaking, UX, graphic design, writing, philosophy and more. It makes for a great community and some really fascinating and varied projects.

My teaching varies each year but often includes mobile development, introductory design and technical subjects, and project supervision.

## Postgraduate Students

I supervise postgraduate students in the [MSc/MA by Research in Interactive Media](https://www.york.ac.uk/tfti/study/postgraduate/research/ma-msc-research-im/), and PhDs through the [Centre for Doctoral Training in Intelligent Games and Game Intelligence (IGGI)](https://iggi.org.uk/), or directly [through the department](https://www.york.ac.uk/tfti/study/postgraduate/funding/) in both research and creative practice.
