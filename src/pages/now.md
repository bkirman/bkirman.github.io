This page is an intermittently updated summary of what I'm currently up to, and where my efforts are currently directed. It is based on [Now pages](https://nownownow.com/about), and the [.plan files](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1288) from back in the day. It is not meant to be a complete summary, just a little note.

Last updated 10/1/22

## Research
* Working on supporting [PlayOn!](/projects/play-on) partners with their new immersive theatre productions. There are some super cool things ongoing that I look forward to sharing later in the year - most productions will be on stage in summer/autumn.
* Developing (with Oliver Bates) the card game output of [Switch Gig](/projects/switch-gig) and the sister project [Flip Gig](http://www.flipgig.org/).
* Currently speaking to people interested in studying games PhDs in the [IGGI](https://iggi.org.uk) CDT (deadline Jan '22)

## Teaching
* Finished another year of the Y3 option Mobile Interaction with our IM students. Another great year with some sound projects.
* Research leave (for PlayOn) from Jan - Mar, then I'll be doing the project prep module for Y2s from April.
* From September I'm looking forward to teaching on IGGI

## Other
* Got a [Bangle.js 2 Espruino watch](https://www.espruino.com/) - my first smart watch. Trying to think of neat things to do with it. It is ace, I like tinkering with it.
* Finally, after 3 years, hit 500 in a [Portsmouth round](https://www.calcresult.com/reference/archery/target_archery_reference.html#PortsmouthRound) with Olympic Recurve (current PB 512).
* End of year board game roundup is 467 plays of 193 different games, (122 new to me), in just 5 places! 
* Finished a bunch of challenges during 2021, including 10x10 (10 games played 10 times each): 6 Nimmt!, Can't Stop, Draftosaurus, Kingdom Builder, MicroMacro: Crime City, Pandemic Legacy: Season 0, Tiger Leader, Warfighter Shadow War, Warfighter WWII, and Zombie Teenz Evolution. And Trek 12 makes it 11x10!
* Finished the 10xDecade challenge, where I play 10 games from 10 years ago. I played A Blood Red Banner, Castles of Burgundy, Dungeon Petz, Flash Point: Fire Rescue, Hawaii, Kingdom Builder, Martian Dice, Revolver, Skull and Taekonoko. All those games were released in 2011. Some have aged better than others.
* Playing and enjoying Megaquarium, MicroMacro, Hitman 3, and Football Manager 22. Tried to play Outer Wilds but it makes me nauseous :(
