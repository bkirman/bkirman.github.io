This page is an intermittently updated summary of what I'm currently up to, and where my efforts are currently directed. It is based on [Now pages](https://nownownow.com/about), and the [.plan files](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1288) from back in the day. It is not meant to be a complete summary, just a little note.

## Research
* Working on supporting [PlayOn!](/projects/play-on) partners with their new immersive theatre productions. There are some super cool things ongoing that I look forward to sharing later in the year - most productions will be on stage in summer/autumn.
* Finalising (with Oliver Bates) the card game output of [Switch Gig](/projects/switch-gig) and the sister project [Flip Gig](http://www.flipgig.org/).

## Teaching
* Project Preparation and Development for Y2 IM UGs, (if you are a York student, see the VLE for material)
* From September I'm looking forward to teaching on IGGI

## Other

* Playing and enjoying Rise to Ruin, Aeon's End: Legacy of Gravehold, ETS2, Airport CEO and We Are Football.
* Feeling like I should do some kind of reflection on all the football stuff at some point - I have read dozens of football books over the past 2 years, and played so many different games of all genre and platform. For now, one strong book recommendation is [*The Miracle of Castel di Sangro* by Joe McGinniss (1999)](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL3928927W/The_Miracle_of_Castel_Di_Sangro?edition=ia%3Amiracleofcasteld00joem_0). It is a wild book, the tale is incredible, but also the author's behaviour gets increasingly bizarre as the story develops (the author has [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Vision_controversy)). Also fun to search the main figures after reading.
