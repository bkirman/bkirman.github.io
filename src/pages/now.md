This page is an intermittently updated summary of what I'm currently up to, and where my efforts are currently directed. It is based on [Now pages](https://nownownow.com/about), and the [.plan files](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1288) from back in the day. It is not meant to be a complete summary, just a little note.

## Research
* Last year was a huge one for [PlayOn!](/projects/play-on). The project concluded in October but it was a really busy time working with partners across Europe and making a load of cool stuff I can't wait to share. The job now is to convert all those notebooks, photographs and interviews into a useful format for sharing. More to come!

## Teaching
* I am Training Coordinator in York for the [IGGI doctoral training centre](https://www.iggi.org.uk). 
* In undergraduate, I am supervising students in the Individual Project module for year 3 Interactive Media students for Semester 2, 2024/25.

## Other

* Still playing a lot of boardgames and setting myself challenges each year. The 10x10 (10 games played 10 times each) for 2024 was Atlantic Chase, Corvette Command, Final Girl, One Key, Sentinels of the Multiverse, So Clover, Stargrave, Stuka Leader, V-Sabotage and Zeppelin Raider.
* 10x10 years (10 Games from 2014) were Colt Express(\*), Hapsburg Eclipse(\*), Legendary Encounters: Alien(\*), Nations: Dice Game, Orl√©ans(\*), Patchwork, Red7, Roll for the Galaxy(\*), Splendor and Warfighter(\*). Asterisks are ones that aged well. 2014 was an exceptionally good year for games!
* I also learned 147 new board/card games, and played 161 different games, a total of 334 times.
