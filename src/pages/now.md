This page is an intermittently updated summary of what I'm currently up to, and where my efforts are currently directed. It is based on [Now pages](https://nownownow.com/about), and the [.plan files](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1288) from back in the day. It is not meant to be a complete summary, just a little note.

## Research
* Continuing working on supporting [PlayOn!](/projects/play-on) partners with their new immersive theatre productions. The next cycle of productions is under development with some really cool projects on the way.
* Several PlayOn productions, including [Áruló](projects/áruló), will be at the [Theatre Olympics](https://szinhaz.org/en/) in Budapest in late May 2023.
* Recently returned from a trip to Norway visiting with [Teatret Vårt](https://www.teatretvart.no/) in Molde, and the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)](https://www.ntnu.edu/alesund) in Ålesund.
* Worked with director György Vidovszky and Kolibri Szinhaz on [Áruló (Traitor)](projects/áruló), which opened in October 22 in Budapest. The production is part of the repertoire and is shown regularly.
* Oliver Bates and I have printed lots of copies of MEAL DEAL, related to [Switch Gig](/projects/switch-gig) and the sister project [Flip Gig](http://www.flipgig.org/). This is a part of a range of critical design artefaces about cycle delivery under the banner "Crank & File"

## Teaching
* I am Training Coordinator in York for the [IGGI doctoral training centre](https://www.iggi.org.uk), and am teaching the Game Design modules in 23/24. 
* In undergraduate, I am leading the Project Preparation & Development module for Interactive Media students in Summer 2023.

## Other

* Playing and enjoying Aeon's End: Past and Future, Next Station: London, Euro Truck Simulator 2(!) and in general the SteamDeck. Tried and failed to enjoy Slay the Spire (again).
* Wanting to play more Viticulture Continents, Frosthaven, and John Company.
* 10x10 for 2022 was Abandon all Artichokes, Aeon's End, Five Parsecs from Home, Hornet Leader: CAO, Railroad Ink, Railways of the World, Roll for the Galaxy, Spruance Leader, Warfighter WWII, Zero Leader.
* 10x10 years (Games from 2012) was Among the Stars, Archipelago, A Fake Artist Goes to New York(\*), Love Letter, Lucky Numbers, Qwixx, Snowdonia(\*), Tea Time, and Trains. Asterisks are ones that aged well. Fake Artist is still the best social deduction game.
* Still feeling like I should do some kind of reflection on all the football stuff at some point - I have read dozens of football books over the past 3 years, and played so many different games of all genre and platform. For now, one strong book recommendation is [*The Miracle of Castel di Sangro* by Joe McGinniss (1999)](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL3928927W/The_Miracle_of_Castel_Di_Sangro?edition=ia%3Amiracleofcasteld00joem_0). It is a wild book, the tale is incredible, but also the author's behaviour gets increasingly bizarre as the story develops (the author has [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Vision_controversy)). Also fun to search up the main figures after reading.
