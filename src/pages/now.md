This page is an intermittently updated summary of what I'm currently up to, and where my efforts are currently directed. It is based on [Now pages](https://nownownow.com/about), and the [.plan files](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1288) from back in the day. It is not meant to be a complete summary, just a little note.

## Research
* Continuing working on supporting [PlayOn!](/projects/play-on) partners with their new immersive theatre productions. The next cycle of productions is under development with some really cool projects on the way.
* I am supporting the brilliant [Julian Jungel](https://www.julianjungel.de/) in running a [Digital Campus](https://play-on.eu/palmela2024/) event this month in Portugal, with students from across europe, as part of Play-On.
* Also working directly on projects with theatres in Portugal and Norway, to be announced soon. It's a busy year!

## Teaching
* I am Training Coordinator in York for the [IGGI doctoral training centre](https://www.iggi.org.uk), and am teaching the Game Design modules in 23/24. 
* In undergraduate, I am leading the Individual Project module for year 3 Interactive Media students for Semester 1, 2023/24.

## Other
* Wanting to play more Sentinels of the Multiverse (DE), John Company, Missile Threat, Rangers of Shadow Deep, Stargrave and Clank: Catacombs.
* 10x10 for 2023 was Rallyman: DIRT, Happy Salmon, Just One, So Clover, Aeon's End, Phantom/Corsair/Stuka Leader (each 10 times!), Warfighter WWII and [Bunch of Butts](https://camdengames.com/products/bunch-of-butts)!
* 10x10 years (Games from 2013) were Skull King(\*), Tajemnicze Domostwo (Mysterium), Blueprints, Russian Railroads(\*), Rampage (Terror in Meeple City), Caverna, Eldritch Horror(\*), Sushi Go(\*), Maquis(\*), String Safari, and Pick-a-Polar Bear. Asterisks are ones that aged well. 2013 was a good year!
* I also learned 113 new board/card games, and played 194, a total of 370 times. That seems like a lot, but I have a friend who completed over 900 plays in 2023!
