This page is an intermittently updated summary of what I'm currently up to, and where my efforts are currently directed. It is based on [Now pages](https://nownownow.com/about), and the [.plan files](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1288) from back in the day. It is not meant to be a complete summary, just a little note.

## Research
* Continuing working on supporting [PlayOn!](/projects/play-on) partners with their new immersive theatre productions. The next cycle of productions starts developing later in November 22.
* Worked with director György Vidovszky and Kolibri Szinhaz on [Áruló (Traitor)](https://kolibriszinhaz.hu/eloadas/arulo/?gallery_only=yes), which opened in October in Budapest. Need to write this up!
* STILL Finalising (with Oliver Bates) the card game MEAL DEAL, related to [Switch Gig](/projects/switch-gig) and the sister project [Flip Gig](http://www.flipgig.org/). This is a part of a range of critical design artefaces about cycle delivery under the banner "Crank & File"
* About to attend the [Mindtrek 22](https://www.mindtrek.org/2022/) conference in Tampere, Finland

## Teaching
* I am Training Coordinator in York for the [IGGI doctoral training centre](https://www.iggi.org.uk), and am teaching the Game Design modules in 22/23 and 23/24. 
* In undergraduate, I will again be leading the Project Preparation & Development module for Interactive Media students in April 2023.

## Other

* Playing and enjoying Five Parsecs from Home, Stardew Valley (again), X4:Foundations.
* Wanting to play more Viticulture Continents, John Company, and various Air Leader games.
* Still feeling like I should do some kind of reflection on all the football stuff at some point - I have read dozens of football books over the past 2 years, and played so many different games of all genre and platform. For now, one strong book recommendation is [*The Miracle of Castel di Sangro* by Joe McGinniss (1999)](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL3928927W/The_Miracle_of_Castel_Di_Sangro?edition=ia%3Amiracleofcasteld00joem_0). It is a wild book, the tale is incredible, but also the author's behaviour gets increasingly bizarre as the story develops (the author has [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Vision_controversy)). Also fun to search up the main figures after reading.
