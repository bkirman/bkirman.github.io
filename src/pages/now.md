This page is an intermittently updated summary of what I'm currently up to, and where my efforts are currently directed. It is based on [Now pages](https://nownownow.com/about), and the [.plan files](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1288) from back in the day. It is not meant to be a complete summary, just a little note.

## Research
* Continuing working on supporting [PlayOn!](/projects/play-on) partners with their new immersive theatre productions.
* Worked with director György Vidovszky and Kolibri Szinhaz on [Áruló (Traitor)](https://kolibriszinhaz.hu/eloadas/arulo/?gallery_only=yes), which will be opening in October in Budapest. Need to write this up
* Finalising (with Oliver Bates) the card game output of [Switch Gig](/projects/switch-gig) and the sister project [Flip Gig](http://www.flipgig.org/).
* Recently presented work from [Switch Gig](/projects/switch-gig) at the Design Research Society conference in Bilbao: Ben Kirman, Oliver Bates, Carolynne Lord, and Hayley Alter (2022) [Thinking Outside the Bag: Worker-led Speculation and the Future of Gig Economy Delivery Platforms](/papers/Kirman2022OutsideTheBag.pdf). In proceedings of 2022 Design Research Society Conference (DRS 2022). Bilbao, Basque Country.
* Imminently attending the [Design Research Works Jamboree](https://jamboree.designresearch.works/home), a residential event about design research, held in the lake district. Very much looking forward to this but also a bit terrified of all the smart people who will be there.

## Teaching
* I will be leading the teaching on Game Design modules for postgraduate students who are joining the IGGI doctoral training centre. I'm looking forward to welcoming the new cohort in October.
* In undergraduate, I will again be leading the Project Preparation & Development module for Interactive Media students in April 2023.

## Other

* Playing and enjoying Viticulture Continents expansion, Bugsnax, Hardspace Shipbreaker, Inscryption, Stellaris.
* Still feeling like I should do some kind of reflection on all the football stuff at some point - I have read dozens of football books over the past 2 years, and played so many different games of all genre and platform. For now, one strong book recommendation is [*The Miracle of Castel di Sangro* by Joe McGinniss (1999)](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL3928927W/The_Miracle_of_Castel_Di_Sangro?edition=ia%3Amiracleofcasteld00joem_0). It is a wild book, the tale is incredible, but also the author's behaviour gets increasingly bizarre as the story develops (the author has [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Vision_controversy)). Also fun to search up the main figures after reading.
