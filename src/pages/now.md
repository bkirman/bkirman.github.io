This page is an intermittently updated summary of what I'm currently up to, and where my efforts are currently directed. It is based on [Now pages](https://nownownow.com/about), and the [.plan files](https://nownownow.com/about) from back in the day. It is not meant to be a complete summary, just a little note.

## Research
* Working on supporting [PlayOn!](/projects/play-on) partners with their new immersive theatre productions. There are some super cool things ongoing that I look forward to sharing next year - most productions will be on stage in summer/autumn.
* Developing (with Oliver Bates) the card game output of [Switch Gig](/projects/switch-gig) and the sister project [Flip Gig](http://www.flipgig.org/).
* Currently speaking to people interested in studying games PhDs in the [IGGI](https://iggi.org.uk) CDT (deadline Jan '22)

## Teaching
* Finishing up another year of the Y3 option Mobile Interaction with our IM students. Another great year with some sound projects.
* Research leave (for PlayOn) from Jan - Mar, then I'll be doing the project prep module for Y2s from April.

## Other
* Got a [Bangle.js 2 Espruino watch](https://www.espruino.com/) - my first smart watch. Trying to think of neat things to do with it. It is ace, I like tinkering with it.
* Trying to hit 500 in a [Portsmouth round](https://www.calcresult.com/reference/archery/target_archery_reference.html#PortsmouthRound) with Olympic Recurve this indoor season (current PB 491)
* Just about finished this year's 10x10 for board games, a few more rounds of [Warfighter Shadow War](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/261624/warfighter-shadow-war-modern-night-combat-card-gam) will do it. Also need 1 more play to finish 10xdecade challenge, where I play 10 games from 10 years ago.
* Playing and enjoying Unpacking, Dinosaur World, Football Manager 22, and Forza Horizon 5. Disappointed by GTA trilogy on Switch.
