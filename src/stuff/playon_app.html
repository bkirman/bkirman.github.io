    <p>This page features links and downloads for the PlayOn! app demo. The aim of this app is to demonstrate mobile features that might be useful to theatres interested in engaging with mobile in their productions.</p>
    <p>The app is currently available for Android, however similar features will work on iOS devices.</p>
    <p>To access it, <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/org.kirman.ben.playon_app_demo">register as a "tester" for the app</a> on Google. You can then <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kirman.ben.playon_app_demo">download the app from Google Play</a></p>

    <p>I have put together a demo app that pulls together a few different features that might be interesting. The aim of this app is to give a brief example of something working, that might be useful as you start to think about the kinds of technology you might use in future productions. You don't have to use this app! It is just for ideas.
    </p><p>The features are intentionally basic, to strip back the complexity of mobile apps you might have used, and the focus is on interaction, and interface elements that might be useful in your theatre production.
        
    </p><p>The demo app is only available for Android, however the features work on iPhone too (it is just harder to share such a demo app through Apple).
        
    </p><p>The app has a selection of features to explore. Of particular interest for partners thinking about "concrete utopias" is the "location" tab, which finds out some features of your current location, and the "remote data" tab, which allows you to give feedback live to a server. On your computer (or another device) you can see the output of this on <a href="https://playon-demo.web.app/">this control panel</a>.
         The app and the control panel are connected live - changes in the control panel affect everyone with the app immediately. You can send notifications, change messages and colours, trigger events and there is a simple voting system. Note it might be confusing if many people are using the control panel at once!
